The world over the decades has made considerable advancement in automation; automation is employed in homes, industries, commercial and educational sectors. In this work, a microcontroller-based automatic school bell is designed. This circuit uses a programmed microcontroller chip to schedule the school teaching and break periods so that for every start or end of a period a bell is automatically rang. This design finds a tremendous use at primary and secondary school levels where the teaching sections can span over eight periods including breaks. The advantage here is that the bell rings at the start of each period without any human intervention to a great degree of accuracy. The time schedule results are compared with that obtained with a clock, however, some drift is noticed, which is negligible
